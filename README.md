### 🏏 Cricket Score Tracker – Flask Web Application

**Description:**

The *Cricket Score Tracker* is a lightweight web application built using **Python** and the **Flask** framework. Designed to simulate basic cricket scorekeeping, this tool enables users to manage batsman performance data in real-time through a simple and intuitive interface.

**Core Features:**

* ✅ Add batsmen dynamically to the scoreboard
* ✅ Enter runs scored and balls faced for each player
* ✅ Automatically calculate and display individual **strike rates**
* ✅ View a clear **summary table** showing all batsmen and their statistics

**Tech Stack:**

* **Python 3**
* **Flask** (with Jinja2 templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering)

**Optional Enhancements Implemented:**

* ⚠️ Validation to prevent division by zero (e.g., when balls faced = 0)
* 🎨 Basic UI styling with **Bootstrap** for better usability
* 🔁 Option to **reset the match** or **remove a batsman** from the list

**Execution:**

The application runs locally using Flask’s development server. The code follows a **modular and clean structure**, ensuring easy readability, maintainability, and extensibility.
